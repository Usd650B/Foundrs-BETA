# MIMIZEN 02 — What is Foundrs-BETA?

## 1. Product Definition
Foundrs-BETA is a daily accountability platform for indie founders and small teams. It combines social goal tracking, lightweight partnerships, and streak-based motivation into one workspace, so builders can share intent each morning, get feedback, and keep shipping.

## 2. The Problem We Solve
1. **Lone-wolf building:** Solo founders often operate without peers, losing momentum and visibility when progress stalls.
2. **Unstructured check-ins:** Traditional tools (chat apps, docs) don’t enforce daily goal clarity or highlight ask/offer moments.
3. **Accountability decay:** Without mutual commitments, goals drift; it’s hard to know who’s available to collaborate, lend expertise, or co-focus.
4. **Fragmented communication:** Goals, messages, milestones, and nudges live in separate tools, making it difficult to keep a tight loop.

## 3. Our Solution & Key Features
| Pain Point | Foundrs-BETA Response |
| --- | --- |
| Need for daily focus | Guided goal composer (priority, success metric, blockers, motivation) keeps entries concise yet rich. |
| No accountability partners | Goal feed exposes who’s working on what; founders can reserve a slot, send a structured request, and spin up a partnership chat instantly. |
| Low motivation / streak loss | Profiles track current & longest streaks, reminders encourage evening check-ins, and completion flows update streak counts automatically. |
| Chaos in collaboration | Shared milestones, typing indicators, video standup scheduler, and notification preferences keep communication in one Supabase-backed experience. |
| Branding friction | Fully custom UI, favicon, and messaging ensure the product feels like Foundrs—not a template export. |

## 4. Outcomes for Users
- **Clarity:** Every morning starts with a concrete intention plus success metric.
- **Support:** Builders discover others tackling similar challenges and can immediately reach out.
- **Consistency:** Streaks, reminders, and goal libraries highlight progress even on messy days.
- **Proof:** Archive of goals + completions provides a narrative for co-founders, investors, or personal retros.

## 5. Why Now?
Remote-first builders crave lightweight ritual without heavy project-management baggage. Foundrs-BETA delivers a calm, beautiful surface focused on human accountability, backed by realtime infra (Supabase + Vercel) that scales with the community.
